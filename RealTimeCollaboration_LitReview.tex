\section{Introduction}

Bioinformatics has become a fast growing field both as a result of advancements in technology and advancements in experimental biological studies. This is evident when looking at the Human Genome Project. These advancements have created a need for collaboration amongst scientists, often working together from across the globe and often across disciplines \cite{li2013ngs,lee2007facilitating,tsiliki2014datamining}. One solution to this problem has been the SEQanswers project. This project tries to improve knowledge sharing by means of an open forum where scientists are able to have discussions specific to genomics \cite{li2012seqanswers}. Another successful community-driven project is the NGS WikiBook, which as the name implies, is a wiki containing lots of information on next-generation sequencing and is a big contributor to knowledge sharing in the genomics field. Other platforms exist but are often closed communities and don't contribute as much to knowledge sharing \cite{li2013ngs}.\\

Knowledge sharing is just one aspect to collaboration. Other forms of collaboration are also necessary, specifically when researchers are in the process of analysing the results of their experiments, such as sequencing data. There is often a need for synchronous collaboration where researchers discuss their findings while viewing the results. Researchers often use visualisations of the data to analyse it which quickly becomes an unfavourable task when researchers are in different geo-locations. A project called DICODE has been designed for the biomedical field in an effort to solve this synchronous collaboration problem. This project incorporates a discussion view, mind-map view, and formal view (predefined knowledge items) allowing teams to collaborate on a project in different ways \cite{karacapilidis2011facilitating}. To create a fully collaborative environment there needs to be support for communication, data sharing, and coordination all relying heavily on technical infrastructure \cite{lee2007facilitating}.\\

This literature review will be focussing on web technologies which enable collaboration such as communication and data sharing, and specifically synchronized viewing across web browsers. Synchronizing web applications across different web browsers has become a popular feature for enabling collaboration. A popular example is Google Docs which is an online text editor. Google Docs enables multiple users to share a single document and are consequently able to view and edit that single document simultaneously. The document synchronizes edits across each user's web browser in real-time \cite{koren2013shared}. More frameworks and libraries are being developed to simplify the integration of synchronization features into any web application \cite{ozono2012real}. The main problem areas with implementing this synchronization are conflict resolution (if two or more users edit the same area in a document the edits somehow need to be merged) and response times (how long it takes for changes to propagate to other connected users) \cite{heinrich2012enriching}. Visualisations can also be synchronized across web browsers, for example viewing a 3D model while moving it around to see it from different angles \cite{marion2012real}. The reason for this literature review is researching the feasibility of implementing synchronization of 2D visualisations, more specifically synchronizing a genome browser to help bioinformaticians analyse a genomic sequence collaboratively.
